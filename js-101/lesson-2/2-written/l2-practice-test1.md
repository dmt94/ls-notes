#### Timed Practice Test Questions ####

**Practice**: written answers to possible assessment questions, focused on core concepts taught in `lesson 2` of **JS101**

<br>

**Focus**: 

- articulate concepts clearly and in correct detail 

- save certain answers if need be (in another file), but this practice is really designed to train real knowledge of fundamentals **within the time frame** that is usually given during the real written assessment.
